# GDB-Remastered

GDB Remastered is an edited version of Mazawrath's Genji Dodgeball

In this version, I take community suggestions to fix, update or add any desired features.
On top of this, I have gone back to several old versions to combine multiple bots to one, updated, stable version to use where you can simply select the bots you wish to use.


### Version History:

#### v1.0.0
##### Code: 8W0CD
###### Patch Notes:
   - Nubgenji
   - Fixed Firebending Map Radius
