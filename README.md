# GDB-Remastered

GDB Remastered is an edited version of Mazawrath's Genji Dodgeball (currently 7.9.1)

In this version, I take community suggestions to fix, update or add any desired features.
On top of this, I have gone back to several old versions to combine multiple bots to one, updated, stable version to use where you can simply select the bots you wish to use.

I plan to keep it updated to the latest version of Genji Dodgeball.

**Current Bots:** Jimothy, Shrek, GOD, and Nubgenji


Quick Tip: Wish to have a chill skrim / practice session alone, or with friends? 

Enable 2x of the Nubgenji bot, and turn on the Endless/Respawn mode! Enjoy an endless round of Genji Dodgeball!


# Version History:

## Version 1.2.0 
**Share Code: QKJRM**

Patch Notes:
   - Fixed Shrek bot's ability to deflect the ball. Should be working properly now.
   - Changed position of the "Bot Enabled" indicator to prevent it from moving side-to-side with long names on the kill-feed.
   - Fixed the bug where God Bot only worked when there was 2 or more players in the lobby.
   - Removed the previous round ball speed from HUD to prevent filling up the left side of the screen.

Known Issues:
   - Jimothy still can't deflect the ball
   - When changing the Nubgenji bot amount or difficulty slider, you may need to reselect nubgenji or preform some other change on the page as the slider does not always update game settings.
